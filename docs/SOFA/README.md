# SOFA

[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework for interactive mechanical simulation, with emphasis on biomechanics and robotics. A series of plugins have been developed to make use of the FEM capabilities and solvers which SOFA offers for simulating soft robotic platforms.

Examples of our platforms can be found in [this](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/sofa-soft-robotics/tree/master) Github repository.
